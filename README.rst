Athaliana-history
------------------------------
`Athaliana-history <http://biocon.berkeley.edu/athaliana>`_ is a site to
interactively browse the results of the positional history of `A. thaliana`
genes from `Freeling lab <http://microscopy.berkeley.edu/~freeling/>`_, UC Berkeley.
The *positional history* refers to whether a gene can be found in its syntenic
locations in a few outgroup species with increasing phylogenetic distance to
`A. thaliana` (`A. lyrata`, papaya, peach, grape).
